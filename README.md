# Assesment1

Overview
This is a simple website dedicated to the history, culture, and travel attractions of Caracas, Venezuela. It provides historical insights, notable landmarks, and travel recommendations for visitors.
Through this page I displayed my hometown in Caracas, I played with the displays and floats to create a soothing to see page, I added a big banner at the start and I used warm colours that i thought would fit the atmosphere of Caracas
For the banner I choose a mustard colour and for the navigation bar I choose an orange colour.

Development
I first started with the home features that would be on every page, like the header, navigation bar, main tag and footer, i did this so that there was consistency all over the website and on every page. I Added bootstrap to my webpage.
At first I did the header, Editing and customizing it, like making it a box with an 100% width that way it takes all over the screen page, customized the fonts and lettering. After that I worked on the navigation bar to which i decided to make it 
centered and when you hover over any of the buttons making it react to it using css.
