# Overview

This is a simple website dedicated to the history, culture, and travel attractions of Caracas, Venezuela. It provides historical insights, notable landmarks, and travel recommendations for visitors. Through this page I displayed my hometown in Caracas, I played with the displays and floats to create a soothing to see page, I added a big banner at the start and I used warm colours that i thought would fit the atmosphere of Caracas For the banner I choose a mustard colour and for the navigation bar I choose an orange colour.
I first started with the home features that would be on every page, like the header, navigation bar, main tag and footer, I did this so that there was consistency all over the website and on every page. I Added bootstrap to my webpage. At first I did the header, Editing and customizing it, like making it a box with a 100% width that way it takes all over the screen page, customize the fonts and lettering. After that I worked on the navigation bar to which I decided to make it centered and when you hover over any of the buttons making it react to it using css.
On the history page I decided to do a column of images on the left side depicting and linking to the information on the right, decided ro use a wine like colour as a border to draw the eye to it
On the visit page I implemented a bootstrap 7:5 column ration and also a navbar that would change the depending on which you clicked, it would display different information using a simple javascript file
# Design Decisions
For the design first i needed to choose a good colour pallet, I decided to go for a warm palette consisting of yellows and reds, on the Home page i decided to put the map on the right and the images on the left to make it look more balanced with everything, as another design choice for the banner i used a background image that would adapt depending on how you looked at the page, for one of the last design choices on the visit page I decided to make the content change depend
Some challenges I faced were on how to change the content when clicking on the navbar, I used w2school to figure out that I needed to use javascript to change it.
